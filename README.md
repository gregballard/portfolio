HTTPServer.zip contains a lightweight http server written in java.  An explanation of its architecture and usage are detailed in the file Documentation.pdf.

Strategy.zip contains the code for a simple strategy game.  This was written in Java using java server pages and web services.  These render html to the client and actions are submitted to the services using form posts.  There is also a Documentation.pdf file that explains the design further.

Bricks.zip contains a proof of concept project I used to experiment with objects in javascript and the HTML5 canvas object.  This is a simple breakout style game where the object is to use the bouncing ball to break the bricks at the top of the screen.   Extracting this zip to a directory and opening "main.htm" in an HTML5 compatible browser will run the program.
